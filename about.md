in order to apply font family that has been imported use: font-family: "get this also from fonts.google"


Remember this 
:root {
  --primary-color: #7c3aed;
  --off-white: #f3f4f6;
  --dark-gray: #6b7280;
}

and while adding color use 
backgroud-color: var(--primary-color);

look into BEM naming convention for CSS

if we have to refer from root: href="/lib/projects.html"
